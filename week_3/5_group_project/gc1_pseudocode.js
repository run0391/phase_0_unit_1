/* Reflection
My Experience throughout this challenge was quite enjoyable. It was my first time working with a larger group than two
people, and unlike my imagination, which was 4 people working on the project at the same time - it was more like a tag 
team kind of work. It was new, and it really made me focus on how much I made my work clearer to the person who was 
working after me. I guess programming in real world works more or less like this, since throughout the various material
that we've studied, making code more readable and accessible to other seemed like to be a big deal. */
