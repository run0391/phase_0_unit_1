## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
Start tracking an untracked file.

#### branch
Starts to list all the branches of current repository. Additional command can be added to this to add, create, remove, or switch branches.

#### checkout
Can be used to branches, commits, and files. When checked out from a commit, the working directory is updated to that commit. Checking out is like a "time machine", where it takes you to an older or newer version of a commit, branch, or file.

#### clone
Makes a copy of the repository into the local repository.

#### commit
Stage changes I've made with messages.

#### fetch
Lets me download from a remote repository

#### log
Lists the past commits I've made.

#### merge
Combines two past changes or histroy to one. Literally, "merge".

#### pull
Is like a fetch followed by a merge. The things I got from "fetch" will be merged to my local repository if I have anything in it.

#### push
Syncs the staged files to the repository.

#### reset
Resets a branch to somewhere else in the history.

#### rm
Stops files from being staged or tracked.

#### status
Prints out the status of current branch or repository.

## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
1. git add <filename>
2. git commit -m "message for commit"
3. git push
- Fetch changes
1. git fetch origine
- Commit locally
1. git commit -m "message"

## Release 5: Reflection

This lesson was kind of a no-brainer for me since I've done additional studying on github when I encountered problems with it on week1. Github is still something very scary to me though, since one little mistake makes everything very complicated. I've learned some valuable things while working on this challenge, such as the difference between fetch, clone, and merge.
