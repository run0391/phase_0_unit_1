##QUIZ
* Q: Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
    * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 
    * Javascript Debugging
    * Performance Optimization 

*A: Google devtools supports all of these options. In the elements tab, the user can edit the html and css code in realtime. After editing, the user can opt into the source tab to save the changes he or she made. Javascript debugging and performance optimizatino can both be done by first using the network tab, then by clicking on the desired file. This will take the user to the file in the sources tab, where he may make amends to the page's bugs. Clicking on the pause icon and refreshing the page will stop the page's code on caught errors, navigating the user to the error in the code. Performance optimization can be further done by using the google extension pagespeed and the online closure compiler. 

*Q: What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?
*A: ctrl+shift+i on windows, alt+command+i on mac.

*Q: Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)
*A: 
  * Original background color: #0b0f11

*Q: For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.
*A: Because the whole black box with text and the emblem is a background gif image. the display of ''<p>'' is blocked. 

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 
  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?
