# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

	*	Responsive web design is making my webpage show its content accordingly to the resolution or device that its being loaded on. I think it's a practice that all web developers should embrace, considering the fast changing resolution of internet capable devices. 

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
	
	*	Smartphones and tablets is what blooms the responsive web design. Before these devices, I don't recall seeing a eye-pleasing mobile view. All I remember is the primitive layout of yahoo.com on flip phones. Technology will bring web design handier ways to adapt with these changes, and maybe we will eventually develop webpages without codes, but with photoshop-like programs. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

	* Visually impaired people use the web with voice overs, and some developers try their best to give them a pleasant experience by going through the labor of making the webpage read an icon by its meaning. I guess we should design and develop for the visually imparied, but I for now do not have the liberty to do that extra work.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

	*	Granting users a comfortable experience on any device they use is what resonated with me the most. What bothers me the most when I load up a page on my phone is a webpage without a mobile view. However, I think someone should start building a standard on phone sizes so that I don't have to do so much extra work!

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
