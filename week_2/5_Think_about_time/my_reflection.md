# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
	
	*	Managing to work 40 hours a week and studying for final exam, while working on the DBC materials.

* How will you combat that? 

	*	For now, my only option is not to sleep. In 2 weeks though, I am reducing my work time to 16 hours a week, and exams will be over. 

* What techniques will you try?

	*	Honestly, I have tried all the resources provided. However, what always works for me is telling myself the same thing over and over again. 
	"First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to"

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

	*	My plan for phase 0 is plain and simple: enjoy it. I joined DBC because I wanted to learn programming every minute I'm awake, and now I have that opportunity to do so!
