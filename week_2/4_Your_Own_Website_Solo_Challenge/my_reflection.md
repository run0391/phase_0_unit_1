Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

	*	from week 1, I learned a lot about design. In week 2, I learned even more. Design is not only about what pleases the eye. Design grants users a more fluid and comfortable experience, and lets the designer guide the users through the page as if he was there. 

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

	*	I think I enjoyed designing the most. To my amazement, wireframing my new index page took much longer than expected. I killed a lot of trees in the process, since everytime I drew a wireframe, new ideas crossed my mind. In the end, I came up with an extremely simple layout, unlike what I've anticipated in the beginning. It was hard to draw the line between unnecessary and "cool".

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

	*	I decided to make a brand new index page for my github.io since it seemed to bland. After coming up with a wireframe, I had to do some research on my own in order to make my website accordingly to its plan since some aspects of it were not covered in the past exercises. Most of it seems to work fine, however the mobile view using media queries and max-width didn't quite work out on my phone. I had to use max-device-width and min-device-width to properly manage it to work on android and ios. 

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

	*	I have a "color" tab on my navigation bar, first designed to change the site's color scheme, but I realized I may need some more time to properly apply this. Other than that, I will work on the media queries a bit more. 

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

	*	min/max-device-width and position:fixed was extremely cool. It took me some time for me to center-align a div, but I eventually ended up making the width 100% to make my page more fluid. Centering the header gives fluidity to some extent, but I soon realized when a webpage gets horizontally shrunk too much, the div ends up not being in the center due to margins that are necessary for its alignment even if I use perecent values for all its dimensions.
	 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
