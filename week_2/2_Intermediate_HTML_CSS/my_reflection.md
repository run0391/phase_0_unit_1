# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

	* web standards are like the constitution of the world wide web. It literally sets "standards" for developers and browsers, increasing ease of access and development simplicity.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
	
	* standard structure, for example font size, still is hard to understand for me. When I load up a page with my phone, 12px font appears different than it does on my pc. I know that phone resolutions are smaller than most computers, so it would make sense that a 12px font size would have to actually be seen larger than on my pc. 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

	* HTML5 and its semantic concept took me a while to grasp, but when I got my head around it I realized it made things much easier to read and develop. While giving literal meanings to divs, applying styles in css was super efficient this way. 

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
	
	* There are many browsers out there, with varying font faces and default elements properties. Reset css literally resets these properties so that my webpage can be shown the same in any browser. 

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

	* I've used chrome, internet explorer, firefox, safari, and mercury on iphone. After tweaking my index.html to fit my iphone, I noticed things showed up a lot differently in my friend's android. I eventually had to go over my style sheet and fix a bunch of codes so that my webpage was showing properly on both devices. This was extremely painful, but there are browsers like chrome which support many attributes that others do not. If all browsers can have the support like chrome does, I think it will be a good thing.
