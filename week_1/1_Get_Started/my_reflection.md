## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I actually set up git and GitHub almost a year ago, so I didn't have to go through the process this time and it is a little rusty.  I don't know if I fully understand navigating through everything at this point, but my understanding is that the repository is where my code is hosted and that I can push changes up to.

I would compare git and GitHub to a little bit of a variation of a google doc.  Git would be having word on your own computer where you can save different versions of word and what you are altering on your own computer does not affect anyone else.  However, you could implement your changes into the Google Doc, which would be like Github, where it is hosted for everyone.  The unique thing here is Github ONLY implements your changes and wouldn't have to replace everything.

Version control allows you to reference prior versions in your process.  Imagine having a folder for every essay that you wrote and you are storing them under a lot of different version/file names so you can reference a prior draft if necessary.  This does the same thing, but it automatically stores a version each time you save something as it overwrites it.

Sometimes as you build code you realize that you didn't forsee something and you would want to go back to a prior state and plan from there how you will implement it. You may also put in some code that breaks something and want to get it back to a non broken state quickly.  To me this makes perfect sense.  I can't think of a better way to approach it.

I wouldn't say there is anything that does not make sense, only things that are not familiar and natural at this point.  Continuing to use this will help overcome that.
