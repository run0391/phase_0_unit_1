## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I've followed the tutorial "Girl Do It" brainlessly trying to figure out what each of the lines of code did. 
It took me a while to figure out that the commit -m "hello" was actually updating the repo with the tracked file and that the phrase between the quotes was a comment left for each modifications. 
I took the initiative to research about git on other websites and go through tutorials there and became a little bit comfortable in understanding how git and github works. 

From my research, I learned that git is a version control software designed to make able multiple people working on the same project without coming in conflict with each others' works. Through version control, developers gain a failsafe environment of work without creating a bunch of copies each time they made changes to the project. 
Git and Github are often misconceived as same programs, and I was one of the people to think this way as well. 
While Git is the version control software, Github is literally the online "hub" where the repositories from the gits are stored either publicly or privately. Privately stored repositories are free to be downloaded and edited, while not reflecting changes to the original repo. Github helps repositories become public to the world, and github users provide developments and modifications to them, making their projects an open source, shape shifting monster. I think even the original developer of a project would not know what their projects might become after being exposed to a level of popularity on github. 

However, a question that I cannot seem to figure out is that after a repo becomes public, and if its repo was privately modified by an unknown user, and this modified repo becomes enormously succesful, bound to make substantial profit, would the original developer have any rights for claiming the profit?
