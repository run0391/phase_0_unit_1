So far everything I learned regarding HTML makes perfect sense to me. I realize that it is not a language like ruby or java, where I can take user inputs or insert conditionals and loops. To me HTML seems like a fairly straight forward language to code in, however it seems to lack further depth. Some aspects of it seem too repetitive, since I cannot have different classes or methods to reduce the lines of code. I wasn't aware css was this simple to write, since I thought it was a completely different language from HTML. However, I now understand that they are correlated with each other. I mostly used google to find the HTML tags and CSS styles I wanted to use, and I believe they were mostly from http://www.w3schools.com/.
