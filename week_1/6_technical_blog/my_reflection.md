## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: itsyou.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?


I realized that I've put most of the information which I should mention in the wireframe_websites.html page. I know that the developers of these websites that I praised or criticized have deeper education and experience in web development, so I found it difficult to judge if my mentions were sound or not. After all, my blog is far worse than the websites that I criticized. I hope this changes in the future!
