Hello all, 


My name is David, I had some problems while lining up my schedule this week so I’m sending you all this introduction pretty late. My apologies.


A little background info about myself:

I grew up in South Korea, studied media science in New Zealand, hotel management in Swiss, and worked as a chief event planner at an entertainment agency in Korea. I have very little knowledge in regards to programming, apart from basic tutorials from online sources and a Java book that I’ve been having fun with. The learning type I got from the prep course of phase 0 was visual and kinesthetic, and although I am not completely sure if it is accurate, I got evaluated as an abstract random and abstract sequential person. 


Currently my favorite sites are:

http://www.wired.com
http://www.fastcompany.com
http://devart.withgoogle.com


I’m having problems with my github right now after I deleted one of my repository seeking for a fresh slate when i ran into a commit error. All my unit1_project folder is unable to sync right now. I’ll find out a way to solve this and send you guys my work as soon as I do. 


Best,


David Hwang

2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

After reading the response of my fellow cohorts, I felt more enthusiastic than ever. Some were worried, and some were seemed more dedicated and ready than others. But all in all, everyone seemed astonished about the new things they learned in just 7 days. Me personally, learning how the internet works and punching in ipconfig in my command prompt made me feel like a hacker and gave me a good vibe. I didn't think the work load was "too much", although this first week my schedule wasn't completely aligned yet. Maybe because the so-called work was just too fun!
