Previously I thought design was only restricted to presentation and functionality of a certain product. After reading design thinking, I realized that design is more of a way of thinking, and one of its main goals, efficiency and functionality is the core values for a business or any project to be successful. Since its prime goal is to meet the needs of the target audience and to succesfully catch their attention, a succesful design varies greatly according to its conditions. 
Wire framing builds the base of a succesfully designed web page, and from my website analysis I noticed how subliminally it works to keep their visitors happy and comfortable navigating on their sites. Just making a website cool is not enough. Without proper plan of what you want the user to read in what order, the web page remains as a bunch of text and images randomly put together. From my research on the 3 websites, I understood how some sites have finer design than others, regardless of the photos or "artistic" values they have. 
I think this challenge was one of my most thoroughly understood challenges, and I enjoyed analyzing my own viewpoint while surfing through my favorite websites.
